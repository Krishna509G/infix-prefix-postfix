# infix-prefix-postfix
This Python program converts expressions between infix, prefix, and postfix forms using stacks. Infix is our normal way of writing equations (A+B), while prefix (+AB) and postfix (AB+) are easier for computers since they avoid brackets and precedence rules. For example, A*(B+C)/D becomes ABC+*D/ in postfix and /*A+BCD in prefix.
